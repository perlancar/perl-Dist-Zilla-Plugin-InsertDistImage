# ABSTRACT: Insert images contained in distribution into POD as HTML snippets

=for Pod::Coverage .+

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In F<share/images>, put some images e.g. F<img1.jpg> and F<img2.png>.

In F<dist.ini>:

 [InsertDistImage]
 ;hosting=metacpan
 ;include_files=...
 ;exclude_files=...
 ;include_file_pattern=...
 ;exclude_file_pattern=...

In F<lib/Foo.pm> or F<bin/bar>:

 ...

 # IMAGE: share/images/img1.jpg
 # IMAGE: share/images/img2.png

 ...

After build, F<lib/Foo.pm> will contain:

 ...

 =begin html

 <img src="https://st.aticpan.org/source/CPANID/Your-Dist-Name-0.123/share/images/img1.jpg" />

 =end html

 =begin html

 <img src="https://st.aticpan.org/source/CPANID/Your-Dist-Name-0.123/share/images/img2.png" />

 =end html


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin finds C<# IMAGE> directive in your POD/code and replace it with
a POD containing HTML snippet to load the images, using the selected hosting
provider's URL scheme.

Rationale: sometimes documentation needs some images. Sometimes the proper (not
to mention convenient) place to put the images is within the distribution
itself. And you want to be able to view the images when you browse the POD in
HTML form.

The C<#IMAGE> directive must occur at the beginning of line and must be followed
by path to the image (relative to the distribution's root). It is recommended to
put the images in F<share/images>.

You can put alternate locations by using C<|>, e.g.:

 # IMAGE: location1.jpg|location2.jpg

This can be useful if you are using hosting=data (where this plugin needs to
read the content of the file) and C<location1.jpg> is produced by another plugin
and might not be ready or added to the build at the time this plugin runs (but
C<location2.jpg> is the temporary version of the file that already exists).

Shared image files deployed inside a tarball (such as one created using
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Tarball>) are not yet supported.


=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 hosting => str (default: metacpan)

Choose hosting provider. Available choices:

=over

=item * metacpan

This is the default because all distributions uploaded to PAUSE/CPAN will
normally show up on L<metacpan.org>. Note that some people advise not to abuse
metacpan.org to host images because metacpan.org is not an image hosting
service. However, at the time of this writing, I couldn't find any mention of
this in the metacpan.org FAQ or About pages.

=item * github

This can only be used if the distribution specifies its repository in its
metadata, and the repository URL's host is github.com.

=item * gitlab

This can only be used if the distribution specifies its repository in its
metadata, and the repository URL's host is gitlab.com.

=item * bitbucket

This can only be used if the distribution specifies its repository in its
metadata, and the repository URL's host is bitbucket.org.

=item * data

Instead of using a remote http/https hosting provider, this will instead use
C<data:> URIs where the image data is directly embedded in the URL.
